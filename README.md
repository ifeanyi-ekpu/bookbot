# BookBot 

**BookBot** is my first Python project! This simple yet powerful tool reads and analyzes text from books, counting words and characters to generate a clear and informative report. Whether you're a book lover, a student, or a developer, BookBot makes it easy to extract insights from text files.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è  

BookBot reads a text file (e.g., `frankenstein.txt`), processes its content, and generates a report that includes:  

- The total number of words.  
- The frequency of each alphabetic character in the text.
